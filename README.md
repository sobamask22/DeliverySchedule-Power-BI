# Project Title: Delivery Schedule Dashboard

Recommendations:

# Project Overview:
Fireaway Pizza store all stock in their warehouse and distribute to franchise stores every week by deliveries. All stock is ordered to the warehouse, the pallets are built per order, and delivered by company drivers and vehicles 6 days a week to various locations across the UK.

The delivery schedule dashboard is a dynamic reporting solution that was designed to deliver insights on stock deliveries to the warehouse. It provides a clear interactive overview of stock delivery times, order status, categories, and country of shipping to enable the manager and managing director to monitor performances and make future decisions.

Business Problem:
The business had an absence of a devlivery schedule and inventory management system making it very difficult to monitor purchase orders and track delivery timelines. Using memory and emails to track these was very inefficient because it limits accuracy and slows decision making for future purchase orders.

Goal:
The dashboard collects raw data using Microsoft Excel, and transforms it into actionable insights through visualizations and data modelling in Power BI. The dashboard enables the stakeholders and logistics manager to view key metrics and make data-driven decisions with confidence.
