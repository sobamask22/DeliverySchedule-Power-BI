# 1: Project Title: Delivery Schedule Dashboard

2: Description:

The delivery schedule dashboard is a dynamic reporting solution was designed to deliver insights to logistic operations. It provides a clear interactive overview of delivery times, order statuses, product categories, and country of shipping to enable stakeholders to monitor performances and make future decisions.

Business Problem: The business had an absence of a devlivery schedule and inventory management system making it very difficult to monitor purchase orders and track delivery timelines. Using memory and emails to track these was very inefficient because it limits accuracy and slows decision making for future purchase Orders.

The dashboard collects raw data using Microsoft Excel, and transforms it into actionable insights through visualizations and data modelling in Power BI. The dashboard enables the Stakeholder and logistics manager to view key metrics and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

3: Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

Python- Used to extract unique tables from general dataset into separate CSV files for analysis

Power BI Desktop- Main visualization platform used to publish the report

Power Query- Used within Power BI for the data transformation and cleaning layer

DAX (Data Analysis Expression)- Used to create calculated measures for KPIs and dynamic filters

Data Modelling- Used to establish relationships between tables for accurate filtering
