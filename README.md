# Project Overview:
Fireaway Pizza store all stock in their warehouse and distribute to franchise stores every week by deliveries. All stock is ordered to the warehouse, the pallets are built per order, and delivered by company drivers and vehicles 6 days a week to various locations across the UK.

The delivery schedule dashboard is a dynamic reporting solution that was designed to deliver insights on stock deliveries to the warehouse. It provides a clear interactive overview of stock delivery times, order status, categories, and country of shipping to enable the manager and managing director to monitor performances and make future decisions.

### Business Problem:
The business had an absence of a devlivery schedule and inventory management system making it very difficult to monitor purchase orders and track delivery timelines. Using memory and emails to track these was very inefficient because it limits accuracy and slows decision making for future purchase orders.

### Goal:
The dashboard collects raw data using Microsoft Excel, and transforms it into actionable insights through visualizations and data modelling in Power BI. The dashboard enables the stakeholders and logistics manager to view key metrics and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

# Executive Summary:
## Overview of report:
The delivery schedule shows the Month over Month (MoM) purchase cost growth of 0.07%, and the (MoM) individual orders growth of 0.05%.
Due to a drop in sales of warehouse stock between April and June there was a surplus in some items meaning less stock was ordered. However, as business slowly picked up again, there was a gradual increase in items ordered into the warehouse to potentially preventing items running out of stock.

# Tech Stack:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
Microsoft Excel:

Python- Used to extract unique tables from general dataset into separate CSV files for analysis

Power BI Desktop- Main visualization platform used to publish the report

Power Query- Used within Power BI for the data transformation and cleaning

DAX (Data Analysis Expression)- Used to create calculated measures for KPIs and dynamic filters

Data Modelling- Used to establish relationships between tables for accurate filtering
